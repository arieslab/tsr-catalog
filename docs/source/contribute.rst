Contributing
-------------

*Suggesting new ideas*

Please create a new topic on GitHub discussions <https://github.com/luana-martins/factor-t/discussions/categories/ideas>`_ to request a new feature. Even if you plan to implement it yourself and submit it back to the project, we would like to know what feature you are working on!

*File bug reports*

If you see something, say something (about bugs)! Please file an issue on the GitHub `issue tracker <https://github.com/luana-martins/factor-t/issues>`_. No quirk is too small for a report. We care about the details.

*How to submit a change?*
Create a fork of our GitHub `repository https://github.com/luana-martins/factor-t>`_, and push your changes to it. Then, you can open a Pull Request to contribute your changes upstream. Make sure to write some notes about what your change does!
